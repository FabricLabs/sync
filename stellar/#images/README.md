# README
Please use all-lowercase for filenames, and replace any
non-alphanumeric characters with a consolidated hyphen.

Wherever possible, name files with something clearly
descriptive or a label.  Ideally, use the most common
part of the name first.

For example, `IMG_2096-2015-09-01.jpg` should be renamed to
`img-2096-2015-09-01.jpg` to assist future explorers in
discovering and easily-finding desired images & files.
