# Introducing ![The Ambassador's Torch][ambassador-torch] THE AMBASSADORS
Hey everyone! @lostamongtrees here, friendly neighborhood greeter, all-around helper, and Assistant Game Master to the Multiverse!  I'm excited to tell you about RPG's newest staff team, The Ambassadors!

![The Ambassador's Torch][ambassador-torch]

Ambassadors can be recognized by their blazing torch, a beacon of light in what might otherwise be a sea of darkness for unsuspecting Internet denizens who, in many cases, have never seen something like RPG before.  While the Ambassadors don't have moderation abilities, they are proudly recognized as leaders in the community nonetheless.  We've selected a handful of excited members to kickstart this initiative, so be sure to say hello when you see them around the site!

## What we do
The Ambassadors are responsible for ensuring RPG's new members are welcomed with warmth & kindness, and for helping both beginners and veterans alike learn the worldbuilding and storytelling tools that we've created over the years.  Thanks to the efforts of our first few team members, we've already begun to show a major impact on the community climate â€” let's take a look at a few of our initiatives!

### The Welcome Forum
Ambassadors are tasked first and foremost with providing rapid responses to new members brave enough to introduce themselves in [url=]the Welcome Forum[/url], where many earn their first INK by baring a few personal details about them 
as writers & role-players.  We will leave no post unanswered!

## Need Help?
Feel free to [url=]contact anyone on the Ambassador team[/url] directly, or open up a thread in [url=]the Help forum[/url] and we'll clammor to respond within a few hours.  While we don't always have the answers, we know everyone who does!
