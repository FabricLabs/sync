We could just copy diablo 2's stat system
Or we could choose one of the following stat systems(or a combination of them):

Basic stats version A
{{

Each level gives you 3 stat points to spend
We will get a better idea of The equations to use after testing

Strength:
	-hp=100+strength
	-melee dmg=10+strength/10
	
Agility:
	-Attack speed:  0 agility= 2 second attack speed
			      100 agility=1 per sec attack speed
			      200 agility=.33333…
			      400 agility=  .2 per sec
	-maybe run speed or run speed could be separate
	-maybe dodge chance
	-maybe stamina
	
Wizardry:
	-Mana cap 100+wizardry
	-mana regeneration   ask Dillon about mana regen speed
	-maybe spell dmg
	
Defense/armor: 
	Approaches 75% damage reduction.
	% dmg reduction per amour unit reduces as armor stat increases
	
Stealth:
	-reduces cpu enemies Viewing distance
	-reduces cpu enemies viewing cone width
	-reduces enemy player viewing distance of you
	
Luck:
	-adds to probability of you dodging
	-makes rare item drops more probable
	-I'm sure there's more
	
Perception:
	-maybe you can see further
	-maybe you can detect stealth units better
	-increases ability to see illusions. Aka detection
}}
	
	
	
Basic stats version B
{{
There is also the option of having individually editable stats. Example: instead of having "strength" you just have hp and melee dmg.
This method is simpler, easier to learn and players have more control over their character.
It is certainly unorthodox, and may come with its own breed of balancing problems. But I like it.
I understand if you don’t wanna go this route.
