## Resources
If you get stuck, ask in [the `#mentorships` channel][mentorships-chat] for a helping hand.  Every Saturday we host an all-day mentoring session, available to anyone willing to work on a project of their own (and we prefer small, one-day projects to start, too!).  Come with a good attitude and an idea for something you'd like to build and we'll be sure to help you realize that vision.
